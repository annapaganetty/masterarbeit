The formulation is based on a generalizationof the efficientand reliable triangular element {DKT} presented in References 1and 2 and on the rectangular element {QC} presented in Reference 3. These elements are derived using the so-called discrete Krichhoff technique. A detailed numerical evaluation of the behaviour of the {DKQ} element for the computation of displacements and stresses for thin plate bending problems is presented and discussed. The {DKQ} element appears to be a simple and reliable 12 degrees-of-freedom thin plate bending element.},

The proposed isogeometric shell discretisation is based on the one hand on the approximation of the mid-surface by a particular class of multi-patch surfaces, called analysis-suitable G1 (Collin et al., 2016), and on the other hand on the use of the globally C1smooth isogeometric multi-patch spline space (Farahat et al., 2023). We use our developed technique within an isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell formulation (Kiendl et al., 2009) to study linear and non-linear shell problems on multi-patch structures. Thereby, the numerical results show the great potential of our method for efficient shell analysis of geometrically complex multi-patch structures which cannot be modelled without the use of extraordinary vertices.},

	abstract = {This work focuses on the coupling of trimmed shell patches using Isogeometric Analysis, based on higher continuity splines that seamlessly meet the C1 requirement of Kirchhoff–Love-based discretizations. Weak enforcement of coupling conditions is achieved through the symmetric interior penalty method, where the fluxes are computed using their correct variationally consistent expression that was only recently proposed and is unprecedentedly adopted herein in the context of coupling conditions. The constitutive relationship accounts for generically laminated materials, although the proposed tests are conducted under the assumption of uniform thickness and lamination sequence. Numerical experiments assess the method for an isotropic and a laminated plate, as well as an isotropic hyperbolic paraboloid shell from the new shell obstacle course. The boundary conditions and domain force are chosen to reproduce manufactured analytical solutions, which are taken as reference to compute rigorous convergence curves in the L2, H1, and H2 norms, that closely approach optimal ones predicted by theory. Additionally, we conduct a final test on a complex structure comprising five intersecting laminated cylindrical shells, whose geometry is directly imported from a {STEP} file. The results exhibit excellent agreement with those obtained through commercial software, showcasing the method’s potential for real-world industrial applications.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an isogeometric formulation for rotation-free thin shell analysis of structures comprised of multiple patches. The structural patches are C1- or higher-order continuous in the interior, and are joined with C0-continuity. The Kirchhoﬀ-Love shell theory that relies on higher-order continuity of the basis functions is employed in the patch interior as in [1]. For the treatment of patch boundaries, a method is developed in which strips of ﬁctitious material with unidirectional bending stiﬀness and zero membrane stiﬀness are added at patch interfaces. The direction of bending stiﬀness is chosen to be transverse to the patch interface. This choice leads to an approximate satisfaction of the appropriate kinematic constraints at patch interfaces without introducing additional stiﬀness to the shell structure. The attractive features of the method include simplicity of implementation and direct applicability to complex, multi-patch shell structures. The good performance of the bending strip method is demonstrated on a set of benchmark examples. Application to a wind turbine rotor subjected to realistic wind loads is also shown. Extension of the bending strip approach to the coupling of solids and shells is proposed and demonstrated numerically.},

	abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse ﬁelds of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as “laws of nature” by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow, 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design — a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after diﬀerences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the classical C1-continuous Bogner-Fox-Schmit ({BFS}) elements are employed to study the buckling behavior of rectangular plates with multiple cutouts. {BFS} elements are constructed by taking the tensor product of cubic Hermitian polynomials, and thus, arguably constitute one of the simplest approaches to deriving plate/shell elements. The simplicity, however, comes at the cost of requiring regular/structured discretizations, which signiﬁcantly restricts their use for applications featuring complex geometrical details. To circumvent this shortcoming, a combination of a ﬁctitious domain approach, in particular the ﬁnite cell method ({FCM}), with {BFS} elements is proposed. Consequently, a typically geometry-conforming discretization is replaced by a structured Cartesian background mesh in conjunction with a more involved numerical integration of the system matrices. This opens the path to analyzing geometrically more complex structures such as plates with one ore more cutouts. Here, the main focus is on the stability (buckling) analysis of such plates. By means of two numerical examples featuring only one circular cutout, it is shown that the critical load can be obtained with high accuracy using the proposed approach. In this context, the attained numerical results are compared with high-ﬁdelity solutions computed using isogeometric analysis ({IGA}). Moreover, the position of a circular cutout is optimized to maximize the critical buckling load, before the last example demonstrates the applicability of Cut {BFS} elements to more complex cutout geometries.},

All elements have 4 nodes and 3 dof per node (one displacement and two rotations) and give good results in classical benchmark and patch tests for thin plates. The paper presents the respective formulation of the four elements in a uniﬁed and comparative manner, starting from the formulation of the classical {DKQ} element published in 1982. The paper includes new convergence behavior analysis using the s-norm tests. The numerical results using {DKMQ}, {DSQ} and {MITC}4 elements show the optimal and uniform convergence for thin and thick plates with a slight advantage for {DKMQ} due to quadratic terms for the rotation variables.},

	abstract = {This study Developed Kirchorff Quadrilateral Elements using an object oriented approach and the Java programming language. A review of the work of Kansara (2004) and Nikishkov (2010) was conducted to develop a finite element program using Java programming language which addresses most of deficiencies inherent in the work of Kansara (2004). Input to the program is done through a text file and the loads that can be applied to the structure include concentrated loads, and uniformly distributed surface loads. Various load combinations can also be used. The program computes displacements and stresses at each node of the finite element model. Several test examples were analyzed using the program and results were compared with those obtained from Kansara(2004), the commercial finite element analysis program {SAP} 2000 and {LISA} respectively. Results were compared at the points of maximum displacements and stresses. The average stress was taken in to consideration to calculate stresses at specific point. The results obtained from the analysis of the example problems were found to be very accurate when compared to those obtained from the Kansara (2004), {SAP} 2000 and {LISA}. The difference in displacements computed by the two programs was less than 1, which is very negligible. The difference in stresses was also quite close. However, stresses in a few cases differed by 5 to 9 \%. The difference in displacements was found to be less than 5 \% for the eight node quadrilateral plate bending ({DKQ}8) element.},

            This is the second part of a two‐part paper on plate bending elements with shear effects included.
            
              This paper presents a new four‐node, 12‐d.o.f. quadrilateral plate bending element valid for the analysis of thick to thin plates. The element called {DKMQ}, has a proper rank (contains no spurious zero‐energy modes), passes the patch test for thin and thick plates in an arbitrary mesh and is free of shear locking. Very good results have been obtained for thin and thick plates by the element. An extended {DKT} element for thick‐plate bending analysis is evaluated in Part I.
